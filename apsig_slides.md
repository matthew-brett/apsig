# Berkeley Fundamentals of Data Science course

* [http://data8.org](http://data8.org/)
* "[The course] combines three perspectives: inferential thinking,
  computational thinking, and real-world relevance."
  [(link)](http://data8.org)
* "The course is designed for entry-level students from any major. It is
  designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics
  or computer science courses."

* Subject-specific [connnector
  courses](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/connectors).
* Since 2015.  Projected enrollment of 2000 students in 2017

* Exploring, cleaning, visualizing data.
* Modeling data with simple algorithms
* Simulation and resampling for statistical inference
* Classification and prediction with machine learning

# How can you help?

* What do you think of the idea?  What could go wrong?
* Do y'all have any datasets you think would be interesting?
* Would you consider giving a guest lecture?
* Would you like to collaborate on writing some teaching material?
* How can I best go about getting hosted Jupyter Notebooks on campus?

# Is this the end?

Yes, it's the end of the talk.
